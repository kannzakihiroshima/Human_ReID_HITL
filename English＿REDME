# Human_ReID_HITL

This project focuses on improving the accuracy of Person Re-Identification (ReID) for estimating pedestrian origin-destination (OD) from multi-camera surveillance images. We propose a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) annotation framework that enhances ReID through iterative model refinement using human feedback.

The framework consists of three main stages:

1. **Initial feature extraction** using a pretrained ReID model.
2. **Candidate selection and manual annotation** to refine labels.
3. **Model retraining** using newly annotated data.

We validate the effectiveness of the HITL-based annotation process using the [MARS dataset](https://github.com/liangzheng06/MARS).

## üìÑ File Descriptions

### `MARS_deal.ipynb`

This notebook extracts appearance features from train, gallery, and query images using a pretrained **ResNet-50** model (trained on MSMT17).

- `pid=0` or `pid=-1` are excluded as these represent background or invalid individuals.
- To handle memory limitations, the extracted features are saved in small chunks (`.pkl` files).

---

### `train_predict.ipynb`

This notebook fine-tunes the extracted features to better identify a selected group of **7 individuals (tracklets)** and then searches for them in a larger dataset.

- Machine learning is implemented in **PyTorch**.
- A customized `ArcFaceLoss` (from `pytorch_metric_learning`) is used, applying class-based weighting to address imbalanced data.
- The human annotation process is **simulated** by referencing ground truth labels internally (this would typically be done manually in a real HITL setup).
- The model is retrained iteratively with new samples.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Future Work

- **Duplicate PIDs in Selection**: The current simulation assumes no duplicate PIDs among the 7 selected tracklets. This is not realistic in real-world applications and needs a solution.
- **Selection Strategy**: It's unclear whether selecting 7 tracklets is optimal. Should more be selected? Should we prioritize diversity or similarity in selection? This requires further investigation.
- **Model Reinitialization**: The model's fully connected layer is reinitialized in each iteration. The impact of this versus retaining previous weights needs to be evaluated.
- **Model Ensemble**: Currently, each model is evaluated independently. Using ensemble strategies across multiple HITL-trained models may improve final ReID accuracy.
